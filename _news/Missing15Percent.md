# The Missing 15 Percent of Patent Citations
[Full paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3754772)

### **Abstract**

Patent citations are one of the most commonly-used metrics in the
innovation literature. Leading uses of patent-to-patent citations are
associated with the quantification of inventions' quality and the
measurement of knowledge flows. Due to their widespread availability,
scholars have exploited citations listed on the front-page of patent
documents. Citations appearing in the full-text of patent documents have
been neglected. We apply modern machine learning methods to extract
these citations from the text of USPTO patent documents. Overall, we are
able to recover an additional 15 percent of patent citations that could
not be found using only front-page data. We show that \'in-text\'
citations bring a different type of information compared to front-page
citations. They exhibit higher text-similarity to the citing patents and
alter the ranking of patent importance. The dataset is available at
