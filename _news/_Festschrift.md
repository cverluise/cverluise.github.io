**9-12 June 2021. Online**


In 1992, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt published "A Model of Growth through Creative Destruction". To honor the 30th anniversary of this publication, Ufuk Akcigit and John Van Reenen are organizing a four-day zoom seminar, followed-up by a book edited at Harvard University Press on "The Economics of Creative Destruction". More than a hundred renowned economists will meet from June 9 to June 12 to present and exchange ideas about how the creative destruction framework offers a fresh lens to think about questions such as:

- What are the effects of creative destruction on employment and health?
- Why did we observed a growth decline despite the IT and AI revolutions?
- How does creative destruction interacts with competition and trade?
- How can we explain and tackle inequalities to make growth more inclusive?
- How can we reconcile growth with the environment, especially the challenge of climate change?
- How should we finance and organize the innovation ecosystem to favor creative destruction?
- How to regulate modern capitalism?
