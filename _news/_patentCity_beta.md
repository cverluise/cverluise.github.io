💥 We are glad to announce that the full patentCity dataset is now available for beta-testing.

📚 The beta database is made of more than 18 million utility patents published at the German (including East German), French, British and US patent offices over the 19th and 20th century. All patents had their patentees geocoded and some were enriched with extra features such as the patentees' occupation and citizenship.

🤗 If you would like to participate, feel free to drop us a mail with a one-line description of your use case and the expected timeline of your feedback at antonin.bergeaud@gmail.com and cyril.verluise@gmail.com.

🤖 The codebase is now open-source and available on the [project GitHub](https://github.com/cverluise/patentcity). Do not forget to star the repository to be notified of future updates. 

🙏We are grateful to Ayman Mhammedi, Benjamin David and Michel Juillard for their invaluable help.

🔁 More to come soon, learn more and join the newsletter at [patentcity.xyz](http://patentcity.xyz), happy for feedback in the meantimes! If you have any comments or questions, feel free to send us an e-mail. 

💌 Feel free to share all around you!
