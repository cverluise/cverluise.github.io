Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a final-year PhD candidate in Economics. My research programme is all about technology diffusion. I leverage data science and natural language processing to unpack the innovation black box - one commit at a time. I have received financial support from Collège de France, PSE, [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).

Prior to starting my PhD, I graduated in Management from [HEC Paris](https://www.hec.edu/en){:target="\_blank"} and Data Science from [ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/en/){:target="\_blank"}. During my last year at HEC Paris, I followed the Quantitative Economics and Finance track taught at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en){:target="\_blank"}. HEC Paris is consistently ranked among the world’s leading business schools, École Polytechnique is the leading French engineering school and ENSAE is the leading French school in data science. 

Since the start of my PhD, my free time has been divided between data science consulting and open source contributions. 

On the consulting side, I worked for [Kayrros](https://www.kayrros.com/){:target="\_blank"}, a fast growing French start-up bringing transparency to the energy sector. I also contributed to [IPwe](https://ipwe.com/){:target="\_blank"}, a start-up on a mission to make the Intellectual Property market more efficient using Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence in partnership with IBM.

On the open source side, [PatCit](https://github.com/cverluise/PatCit){:target="\_blank"} has been and remains my main project. It aims at connecting patents to the rest of the Innovation system (scientific articles, technological standards, etc) by leveraging non-standard and in-text patent citations that were previously unused. It involves large data pipelines and Natural Language Processing at scale. The project keeps improving and has already found its fair amount of users (and stars) and the resulting dataset counts more than [5,000 downloads](https://zenodo.org/record/4391095). 

<p style="font-family:courier">After completing my PhD in October 2021, I want to jump into a data science position in the tech industry. I would love to hear from you and your project, drop me a line!</p>
