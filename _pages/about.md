I am a senior data scientist at QuantumBlack. I build and ship tech 
products to the industry.

At QuantumBlack, I spearhead the technical and product development as well as the deployment of energy system optimisation solutions. My work has led to a patent filing (pending, [US-20240077895-A1](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240077895A1)). I have also contributed to power grid and power generating device optimisation work. Beyond the energy sector, I played a leading role in the development of an earth observation platform.

Before that, I did a PhD in Economics. I leveraged data 
science and natural language processing to 
unpack the innovation diffusion black box - one commit at a time.
My work has been published in top-tier journals, cited in prestigious media outlets including [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/30/its-not-just-a-fiscal-fiasco-greying-economies-also-innovate-less), and my open-source projects have garnered 160+ stars on GitHub and 15k+ downloads overall. I am thankful to Collège de France, 
[Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/){:target="\_blank"}, 
[EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/){:target="\_blank"} and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/){:target="\_blank"} for their financial support. 

Before and during my PhD, I worked as a data scientist, mainly as a contractor. I 
worked at [Kayrros](https://www.kayrros.com/){:target="\_blank"}, 
a French scale-up bringing transparency to the energy sector. I also 
contributed to [IPwe](https://ipwe.com/){:target="\_blank"}, a start-up on a mission 
to make the Intellectual Property market more efficient using Blockchain and 
Artificial Intelligence in partnership with IBM. Finally, I served at 
[CarbonFact](https://www.carbonfact.com/){:target="\_blank"}, a YC-backed start-up 
dedicated to automated carbon accounting of fashion items.   

In my early academic life, I graduated in Management from 
[HEC Paris](https://www.hec.edu/en){:target="\_blank"}, in Data Science from 
[ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/en/){:target="\_blank"} and in Economics from 
[Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en){:target="\_blank"}. I also 
completed B.A.s in Applied Mathematics, Economics and Politics at [Université Paris I 
Pantheon-Sorbonne](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/){:target="\_blank"}.
