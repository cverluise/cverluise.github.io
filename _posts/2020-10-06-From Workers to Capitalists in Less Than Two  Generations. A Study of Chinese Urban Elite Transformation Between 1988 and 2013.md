## Motivation

-   Last 40 years: Chinese economic growth unprecedented
-   Same time, dramatic increase in GINI

## What/How they do?

-   Use harmonized household surveys covering 1988-2013 -\> Focus on economic elites in urban CN. 
-   Split the country into 3 zones (East, central, West)
-   Relatively consistent data over this short period although equivalent to 2 centuries of growth in the US or GB.

## Related Literature

Early focus of the CN econ literature on:

-   Industrial sector (structural change)
-   Political dominance & econ

-\> Not much on inequalities and economic elite so far

## Stat desc on the economic elite

-   Share of elite into total income is increasing since 1988 -\> 21% to 30% for top 10%
-   Focusing on the source of income of the top 5 percent, their income used to be largely dominated by public sector income, it's now less than 50%. 
-   Elite income from the private sector increases 10 times from 0.8% of total urban income to 8% of total urban income.

## Social composition of the top 5%

-   3/4 are the old social groups (workers, clerical, government officers)
-   In 2013, half of the elites are from the new social groups (professionals, business owners)

-   Workers are under-represented in the top 5% while Professionals and
    Private Business wonders are over-represented

## Education composition of the top-5%

-   The share of university graduates goes from 12% to 44% between 1988 and 2013
-   Primary and middle educated people are the declining group(70%-\>25%) in the same 
 
## Communist party membership & the top 5%

-   6% of the population is a member of the communist party
-   within the top-5%, it is between 40% and 50%. 
-   CCP membership is however *non* significant to explain income, except for big business owners.
