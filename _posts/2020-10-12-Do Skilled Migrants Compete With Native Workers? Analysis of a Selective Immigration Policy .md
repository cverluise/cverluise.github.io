# Do skilled migrants compete with native workers? Analysis of a selective immigration policy

## Motivation


- High-skilled migration central in public debate
- Long list of selective immigration policies (CAN, AUS, USA, etc)
- Recent changes: USA freeze H-1B "as a way to protect domestic jobs"

## Related Literature


- Canonical model: the labor demand is downward sloping -\> migration shock depress wages of similar workers
- Empirical findings: fail to find large negative effects (aka "mild wage effect"). Various explanations:
- Cells delineating competitive space in terms of education/jobs are too large
- Migrants suffer skill downgrading when they migrate
- Natives switch to better occupations

## What/how she does?


- **Research question**: What is the impact of a high skill migration shock on employment and wages of domestic workers?
- **Actual empirical approach**: looks at a 2008 French reform easing the hiring of immigrant employees within a list of tech occupations for non EU migrants.
- **Causality**: Use this natural experiment to study the mechanisms behind mild wage effects

## Findings


- Employment level
    - +1.4% in employment level in the targeted occupations

- Hires
    - Migrant hires in reform occupations: +50%
    - Natives unaffected
- Wages
    - average wages: -3.6% migrant vs natives unaffected
    - hiring wages: -14.6% migrant vs -7.5% for natives

- Channels
    - Statistical support for: the technological story (natives and migrants are actually not perfect substitutes in terms of skills) and bargaining power (lower bargaining power for migrants)
    - No clear support for: composition effect (natives flying to other occupations) skill downgrading

## Conceptual framework

-   Standard model of supply and demand
-   Only specificity: the supply and demand curve meet at a point where labor supply is mostly inelastic - reflects *tight* market

    </div>
</div>

-\> We expect migration to affect the elasticity

## Data

- Employer employee data
- Panel data

## Identification

- Treated group: occupation in the list of 30 open to all non EU

- Control group: extended list of occupations with tightness above mean but not treated

## Results

#### Employment


+1.4% in eq. employment (level) in targeted occupations

### Hiring

+50% number of migrants hired

+16% share of migrants in new hires

+15% proba hiring a migrant

no significant effect on native hires

### Wages

**-3.6% on migrant average wages**

**No significant effect on native** ***average*** **wages**

**-14.5% in migrant hiring wages**

**-6.9% on native** ***hiring*** **wages**


## Channels


-   *Technology? Imperfect substitution in actual production -\> would mean that task diversity should make the effect larger*
-   *Differences in bargaining power through outside options*
-   ~~Composition effects through native flight~~
-   ~~Skill downgrading~~

> Both the tech and bargaining power seem to be part of the story - cannot say which effect is larger though.

## Conclusion


-   Increased lastingly migrant hires in targeted jobs w/o harming native employment -\> tightness reduced
-   Negative pressure on wages is twice larger on migrants than natives

-   Channels: imperfect substitution (technology story) & difference in bargaining power


## Appendix: The 2008 French reform {#a-the-2008-french-reform}


### Set-up

-   Abolishes 2 major requirements to migrant hiring:
    -   Proof of prior search of a resident
    -   Tightness of the labor market (at the occupation level)

-   Introduced in 2008
    -   30 tight occupations *-\> no clear threshold though (key for identification)*
    -   Different sub-sample across regions

-   Part of a larger reform

    </div>
</div>

### Tightness indicator

-   job offers/job seekers
-   evolution of job offers
-   evolution of job seekers
-   turnover rate
-   share of long term contracts in job offers
