patentCity is the data backbone of Bergeaud and Verluise (2021). It is a flexible framework to extract and structure vital information (for research) from historical patents as a way to unveil the unknown history of innovation. We open source our codebase to support future extensions and a collaborative way to create and continuously improve research databases. patentCity is due to expand and improve continuously in the coming years. You can learn more about patentcity and explore the data online at [patentcity.xyz](patentcity.xyz).

📚 The patentCity database is a comprehensive database reporting patentees' data extracted from patent texts as well as enriched data since the 19th century in Germany (including East Germany), France, Great Britain and the USA.

💥 The goal of the database is to spur research on the history of innovation and to deepen the set of natural experiments from which historians, economists and scientists in general can learn to improve our understanding of innovation dynamics.
