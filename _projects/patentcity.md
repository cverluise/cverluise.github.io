patentCity is the data backbone of Bergeaud and Verluise (2021). It is a flexible framework to extract and structure vital information (for research) from historical patents as a way to unveil the unknown history of innovation. We plan to open source our code to support future extensions and a collaborative way to create and continuously improve research databases. patentCity is due to expand and improve continuously in the coming years.
