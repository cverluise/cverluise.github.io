patentCity is the alhorithmic backbone of Verluise and Begeaud (2021). We build upon the ["Automated Patent Landscaping"](https://github.com/google/patents-public-data/blob/master/models/landscaping/README.md) approach open sourced by Google Patents to accurately delineate a well-defined technology from the worldwide corpus of patents. We plan to open source our code to support future extensions and a collaborative way to create and continuously improve research databases. techLandscape is due to expand and improve continuously in the coming years.
