Some variations but overall stable until now.

Coal has not disappeared, consumption stoped growing. Same for oil.</p> <h3 id="energy-growth-consumption">Energy Growth Consumption</h3> <p>As human-being, we are using approx 4x more energy today than 200 years ago, world average.

E.g. in the US, there was a joint effort from the oil and car industry to limit the outcome of the Truman momentum to support solar power and decentralized energy production.
